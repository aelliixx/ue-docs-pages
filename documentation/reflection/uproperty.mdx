    This page is still a work in progress. Some specifiers may not be included or are
    inaccurate.
</Note>

Unreal Engine property specifiers define how properties behave within engine and editor contexts. They are similar
to Unity Engine's (or more accurately C#'s) attributes in that they introduce a static-reflection-like behaviour to C++.
Specifiers allow you to define various attributes of the property, such as how the property should be serialised,
replicated across a network, or displayed in the editor.

Official Unreal Engine documentation provides a decent list of property specifiers, but not a complete one, missing
important attributes and lacking implementation details. This page is an attempt to provide clear implementation examples,
and descriptions for the various attributes.

If you're looking for an exhaustive and detailed list of property specifiers, check out [Ben ui](https://benui.ca/unreal/uproperty)'s
which also provides great usage examples.

The following specifiers are categorised according to their relevant editor context and are listed roughly in the order
of most to least often used.


## Syntax

```cpp
UPROPERTY([specifier, specifier, ...], [meta(key=value, key=value, ...)])
Type VariableName;
```

## Examples
```cpp
UCLASS()
class USomeClass : public UObject
{
// ...
private:
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Character", meta=(AllowPrivateAccess=true))
    int32 Score;
// ...
}
```
The above code defines an `int32` variable `Score`. The UPROPERTY specifier allows `Score` value to be edited anywhere - both
in the details panel in a blueprint or the instance of said blueprint in the map; allows blueprints to read (get) or write
(set) its value. It also sets its category to Character, therefore the input field for this variable in the details panel
will be under Character.

The meta attribute `AllowPrivateAccess` being set to true allows blueprints to access the property
even when it is defined in a private block; omitting it would result in a compile time error and would require us to define
the Score property publicly.

getter for 'Score' property, and likewise, the details panel shows a read-only 'Score' numeric input field.](images/uproperty_example.png)

## Editor Specifiers

<Block>
    <Specifier type="UPROPERTY" name="VisibleAnywhere"/>
    <SpecifierMeta position="Specifier" type="Flag" incompatible={
        ["VisibleDefaultsOnly",
            "VisibleInstanceOnly",
            "EditAnywhere",
            "EditDefaultsOnly",
            "EditInstanceOnly"]
    } related={["BlueprintReadOnly"]}/>
    Makes the property visible to both class defaults detail panel in blueprint assets (archetypes) and the blueprint
    instances in maps (instances), *but not editable in either*.

    This is useful when you want to quickly look up the value of a property in a blueprint or an instance thereof,
    but don't want blueprint users modify it.

    Note that while the details panels expose the property as read-write, it is not exposed to blueprint graphs.
    To do so, take a look at the Blueprint section of this page for `BlueprintReadOnly` and `BlueprintReadWrite`
    specifiers.
</Block>
<Block>
    <Specifier type="UPROPERTY" name="VisibleDefaultsOnly"/>
    <SpecifierMeta position="Specifier" type="Flag" incompatible={
        ["VisibleAnywhere",
            "VisibleInstanceOnly",
            "EditAnywhere",
            "EditDefaultsOnly",
            "EditInstanceOnly"]
    } related={["BlueprintReadOnly"]}/>
    Makes the property visible only to the class defaults detail panel in blueprint assets (archetypes).

    Similarly to `VisibleAnywhere` this is useful when you wish to expose a read-only value to the blueprints,
    but don't want blueprint users modify it.

    Much like the `EditDefaultsOnly`, the word "Defaults" refers to the "Class Defaults" details panel within the
    blueprint asset.

    Note that while the details panels expose the property as read-write, it is not exposed to blueprint graphs.
    To do so, take a look at the Blueprint section of this page for `BlueprintReadOnly` and `BlueprintReadWrite`
    specifiers.
</Block>
<Block>
    <Specifier type="UPROPERTY" name="VisibleInstanceOnly"/>
    <SpecifierMeta position="Specifier" type="Flag" incompatible={
        ["VisibleAnywhere",
            "VisibleDefaultsOnly",
            "EditAnywhere",
            "EditDefaultsOnly",
            "EditInstanceOnly"]
    } related={[]}/>
    Makes the property visible only to the details panel of blueprint instances within a map (instances).

    Can be useful to expose a quick look up to a value which changes at runtime but should not be modified by the blueprint
    users and is not useful to know in the class defaults panel. For example, `currentHealth` which can change at runtime
    as a result of received damage but isn't very useful in class defaults when the game is not running.

    Much like the `EditInstanceOnly`, the word "Instance" refers to the specific instance of a blueprint placed in a
    map. To view its details, select the actor in the world outliner.

    Note that while the details panels expose the property as read-write, it is not exposed to blueprint graphs.
    To do so, take a look at the Blueprint section of this page for `BlueprintReadOnly` and `BlueprintReadWrite`
    specifiers.

            "VisibleDefaultsOnly",
            "VisibleInstanceOnly"]
    } related={["BlueprintReadWrite"]}/>
    Makes the property editable in class defaults details panel in blueprint assets (archetypes) as well as
    instances of the blueprint in maps (instances). It is similar to `VisibleAnywhere` but it also allows for changing
    the value.

    Useful when you want blueprint users to tweak the default value without going into C++ and each instance may have
    a unique value.

    Note that while the details panels expose the property as read-write, it is not exposed to blueprint graphs.
    To do so, take a look at the Blueprint section of this page for `BlueprintReadOnly` and `BlueprintReadWrite`

    Makes the property editable only in class defaults details panel in blueprint assets. It is similar to
    `VisibleDefaultsOnly` but it also allows for changing the value.

    Useful when you want to allow blueprint users to tweak the default value but all instances must have the same value.

    } related={[]}/>
    Makes the property editable only in the details panel of blueprint instances within a map (instances).

    Useful when you want a C++ defined default value, but allow blueprint users to manually change it for each instance.

    Much like the `ViewInstanceOnly`, the word "Instance" refers to the specific instance of a blueprint placed in a
    map. To view and edit its details, select the actor in the world outliner.
