<Block>
    <Specifier type="UPROPERTY" name="VisibleEverywhere"/>
    <SpecifierMeta position="Specifier" type="Flag" incompatible={
        ["VisibleDefaultsOnly", "VisibleDefaultsOnly",
            "VisibleInstanceOnly",
            "EditAnywhere",
            "EditDefaultsOnly",
            "EditInstanceOnly"]
    } related={[]}/>

    Properties marked with `VisibleAnywhere` are visible in the both Details Panel of Blueprint assets and the Details
    Panel
    of Blueprint instances within maps. Note that this refers to being visible in the Details Panel, not visible in the
    Blueprint Graph. For that you need to use BlueprintReadOnly.
